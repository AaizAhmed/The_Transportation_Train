Project Details:

OS Used: 	   Windows 7/10
System Type:   64-bit Operating System

Language Used: Java
Compiler/Running environment: Java Development Kit (JDK) is required on the machine in which you
	want to run the program. Java Runtime Environment (JRE) should be fine to run the program as
	well.

Download Java SDK for your architecture using the following URL: 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Build/Run: I used Eclipse IDE for this project. Inside eclipse create a new java project
		   and put all the .java files in one package and call it "proj5". Project5.java contains main(), run it 
		   and the game should start.

NOTE: If you use Eclipse to develop the project put input.txt outside the src folder otherwise the program
      will not run. To give command line arguments click on Run then Run Configurations, a window will open.
      In the window click on the Arguments tab located under the Name of the project. You will see a text
      box names Program Arguments, add the arguments here separated by a space. Five arguments needs to be
      added as mentioned in the PDF description for the program to execute. 

Files written by me:
1)	BocCar.java
2)	BoxFullException.java
3)	Cargo.java
4)	MaxSpeedException.java
5)	MinSpeedException.java
6)	NoSuchItemException.java
7)	Person.java
8)	Project5.java
9)	Train.java
10)	WrongTypeException.java


Comments: This project requires the use of generic classes to store different types of data. Inheritance, 
          exception handling and use of Comparable <T> is also part of the project. You need to 
          provide 5 arguments mentioned in the PDF description for the project to run.
